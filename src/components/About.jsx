        I am a self-taught and course-completed programmer skilled in Python, Java, Spring Boot, Spring MVC, SQL, Docker, and Docker Compose,
        currently seeking an opportunity to enter the IT sector.
        I am driven to expand my knowledge in areas such as databases, big data, front-end and full-stack development, frameworks like React + Vite, 
        cloud computing, and machine learning. I am looking to join a company that values innovation, collaboration, and continuous learning, 
        and I am confident that my enthusiasm and drive will help me succeed in any role that leverages my passion for technology.
        Currently, I am working on a self-initiated ERP software project called SLAM (Storage, Logistics, and Accounting Management), 
        designed for micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises. The project is over 95% complete on the backend, developed with Spring Boot, REST APIs, JWT security,
        and Docker-based testing, while the frontend is being built with React and Vite.
        My goal with SLAM is to create a scalable, open-source ERP solution tailored to the real-world needs of growing businesses,
        especially in regions affected by disrupted supply chains. The project is fully documented on GitHub and serves as both a personal challenge and a professional showcase.
